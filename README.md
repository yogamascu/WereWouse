## About
This a capstone 1 project PWD-Jogja JC-DSC03

WereWouse application was released in Q2 2024 and developed by Unpretentinous.Inc. Assisting small-sized bussiness owners especially to those whose engaged in inventory management, this then becomes our motivation for the develoyment of this application. We would like to show small-scale business owners that they could definitley keep their inventory with simple interface yet impeccable. Overall, the WereWouse utilizes four functions that such as;

1. **Read stock**, WereWouse displays the entire stock of items available in the database, and you will always get the latest updates from your database.
2. **Add stock**, WereWouse helps you register new items and update existing items, such as quantity or price.
3. **Delete stock**, WereWouse provides high mobility to remove items that you do not need or have expired.
4. **Purchase**, WereWouse provides an experience for customers to purchase and pay for any item from anywhere at any time.

Sepcifically for the try out WereWouse app, a fictional warehouse/store called: Maju-Depo has been volunteered for this project, hence, the app using mock data that has been personalized to suit Maju-Depo.
